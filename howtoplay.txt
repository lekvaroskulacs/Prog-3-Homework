Masyu is played on a rectangular grid of squares, some of which contain circles; each circle is either "white" (empty) or "black" (filled). 
The goal is to draw a single continuous non-intersecting loop that properly passes through all circled cells. 
The loop must "enter" each cell it passes through from the center of one of its four sides and "exit" from a different side; all turns are therefore 90 degrees.

The rules are simple:

1. A black circle must have a line turning a corner on it, this line must continue one square after each side of the circle.
2. A white circle must have a straight line through it, this line has another condition, it must turn a corner one square after the circle on either one of the ends or both of the ends.
3. The line made must go to adjecent squares, there are no diagonals.
4. The line must go in a full loop, both ends connecting.
5. The line cannot overlap itself or branch off. (Drawing will be blocked in this case, don't be surprised.)
6. Every change of direction other than straight has to be at a 90Â° angle.
